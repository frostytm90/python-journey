# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a classic two-player game implemented in Python. This project is part of my Python learning journey, showcasing basic concepts of game logic, user input handling, and control flow.

## Overview
This is a command-line version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Key Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Supports two players (X and O) taking turns.
- **Simple Interface**: Command-line interaction with a clear visual representation of the board.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically checks for a winning condition or a draw after each move.

## Motivation
I built this project to enhance my understanding of control flow, loops, and conditionals in Python. It was also a fun way to apply problem-solving skills and learn about user input validation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The entire game is implemented in Python, focusing on basic data structures like lists.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/frostytm90/python-journey.git
   ```
2. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal and run the Python script.
   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: The game starts with player X.
2. **Take Turns**: Players are prompted to select a row and column for their move.
3. **Winning or Draw**: The game ends when a player wins by aligning three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

## Possible Areas for Improvement
- **Input Validation**: Add input validation to ensure that row and column inputs are within the valid range.
- **Replay Option**: Allow players to replay the game without restarting the script.
- **Improved User Experience**: Provide more descriptive prompts and messages to make the game more engaging.
- **GUI Implementation**: Develop a graphical user interface for a more visually appealing and interactive experience.

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance the game by:
- Adding input validation to ensure users enter valid moves.
- Allowing players to choose their symbols (e.g., X or O).
- Adding a replay feature so users can play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
- Creating a graphical version using a Python GUI library like Tkinter for an improved user experience.

## Comments and Areas for Improvement in Code
- **User Experience**: Improve prompts to make the game more intuitive and engaging.
- **Refactoring**: Refactor code into separate functions for better readability and maintainability.
- **Replay Option**: Add functionality to ask players if they want to play another game at the end.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback on how to make this game better!
