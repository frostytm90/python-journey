# Text-Based Calculator

Welcome to the **Text-Based Calculator**, a simple command-line calculator built with Python. This project is part of my Python learning journey and demonstrates how to use basic arithmetic operations, user input handling, and input validation.

## Overview
This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It takes user input for the numbers and the operation they wish to perform.

## Key Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and exponentiation (`**`).
- **User Input Handling**: Accepts numbers and operation signs from the user.
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid number inputs by prompting the user until a valid number is provided.

## Motivation
I created this project to improve my understanding of handling user inputs, performing calculations, and implementing basic error handling in Python. It was a useful exercise to practice Python's control flow and exception handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The calculator is implemented in Python, focusing on simplicity and command-line interaction.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/frostytm90/python-journey.git
   ```
2. **Run the Script**: Open your terminal and run the Python script.
   ```
   python text_base_calculator.py
   ```

## How to Use
1. **Enter the Numbers**: You will be prompted to enter two numbers.
2. **Enter the Operation**: Enter one of the supported arithmetic operation signs (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`).
3. **View the Result**: The result of the calculation will be displayed on the screen.

## Possible Areas for Improvement
- **Error Handling for Division by Zero**: Currently, the app checks for zero in division but could provide more detailed feedback.
- **Loop for Multiple Calculations**: Add a feature that allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
- **Extended Operations**: Add more operations like modulus (`%`) or support for advanced mathematical functions.
- **GUI Interface**: Implement a graphical user interface to enhance user interaction and make the app more user-friendly.

## Future Improvements
I plan to improve the calculator by:
- Implementing a loop to allow continuous calculations.
- Adding input validation for the operation sign.
- Refactoring the code into modular functions to improve readability.
- Adding more mathematical operations, like trigonometric or logarithmic functions.

## Comments and Areas for Improvement in Code
- **Modularization**: Refactor arithmetic operations into separate functions to make the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Input Validation**: Add better input validation for the operation sign.
- **Error Handling**: Improve the way division by zero is handled to provide clearer and more user-friendly messages.
