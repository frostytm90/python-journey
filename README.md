# My Python Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository, showcasing various Python projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts, from basic input handling to more advanced features like API integration and persistent storage.

# Python Projects

## Projects Overview
Here is a list of the projects included in this repository, each highlighting different areas of Python development:

### 1. Text-Based Adventure Game
A simple text-based adventure where users make choices to progress in the story. This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, user input handling, and basic game flow logic.

- **Features**: User choice, branching paths, simple combat.
- **Technology**: Python

### 2. Text-Based Calculator
A command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project helped me practice user input validation and arithmetic logic.

- **Features**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation.
- **Technology**: Python

### 3. Contact Management System
A command-line program to manage contact information. Users can add, delete, search, and store contacts persistently in a JSON file.

- **Features**: Add, delete, search contacts, persistent storage.
- **Technology**: Python, JSON

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic two-player game implemented in Python. Players take turns placing symbols on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three symbols wins.

- **Features**: Two-player mode, winner detection, draw condition.
- **Technology**: Python

## Motivation
The motivation behind these projects is to learn Python and understand how to apply it to real-world problems. By creating a variety of projects, I have explored different aspects of Python programming, such as data structures, user input validation, file handling, and game logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all the projects.
- **JSON**: Used in the Contact Management System for data persistence.

## Future Goals
I plan to continue adding projects to this repository as I learn more about Python and programming in general. Some goals include:
- **Adding GUI interfaces**: I would like to implement GUIs for some of these projects to make them more user-friendly.
- **Exploring more complex algorithms**: Building more advanced projects that involve data processing or algorithmic challenges.

## How to Run the Projects
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
